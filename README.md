# text-summerization
Text summarization is the process of condensing a long text into a shorter version while retaining key information. It is useful for quickly understanding large volumes of information and is categorized into two main types: extractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization selects important sentences directly from the original text, relying on techniques like TextRank, LexRank, or BERT-based models. In contrast, abstractive summarization generates new sentences that convey the same meaning concisely, using deep learning models such as T5, BART, and GPT. It is widely used in applications like news articles, research papers, and legal documents. AI-based models are often trained using datasets like CNN/Daily Mail and XSum to enhance their summarization capabilities. A good summary should be coherent, concise, and retain essential details while avoiding redundancy. NLP techniques such as tokenization, sentence ranking, and embeddings help improve summarization quality, and pre-trained transformer models further enhance accuracy. Evaluation metrics like the ROUGE score compare AI-generated summaries with human-written ones to assess performance. Text summarization is commonly used in chatbots, document processing, and SEO optimization. APIs like Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers provide easy access to pre-built summarization models, while custom training on domain-specific data improves relevance. Challenges in summarization include handling ambiguity, ensuring factual consistency, and mitigating bias. Future advancements focus on developing more context-aware and explainable models. Open-source libraries such as SpaCy, NLTK, and Sumy offer useful tools for text summarization. As AI continues to evolve, text summarization remains a crucial technology for improving the efficiency of information consumption.
